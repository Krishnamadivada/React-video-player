# React Video Player App

This project mainly contains two components.\
1.Video Player.\
2.Playlist\

The Video player component uses a library [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player) for video playing and controls.

The playlist component displays a list of videos Which were rendered from an array.

It has Autoplay feature. The videos will be automatically played one after the other.

This app is responsive to all screen sizes.

I have used normal CSS instead of Tailwind CSS or styled-components for styling. I have just started learning Tailwind CSS and styled-components, so i am not able to use that.

After Cloning the Repo, Run npm install and then npm start which will Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
